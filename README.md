# Project intro
Budgeteer is a personal finance tracker app that <b>we developed for ourselves and all our friends</b> that are willing to get summarized statistics based on their income and expenses and understand the spending habits. <br>
<br>
It grew into the mini app from us  tracking personal finances in <i>Google Sheets</i> but still using <i>"Saved Messages"</i> on <i>Telegram</i> to note something "real quick" before actually adding into the tracking sheet.

### Team 
The team behind this mini app is <a href="github.com/qpwedev"> qdev studio</a>. 

## Key functionality
The app allows to go through the<b> whole flow of the personal finances tracking</b>: <br>
<li> Authentificating with Telegram to create an account </li>
<li>Adding an income transaction and a tag</li>
<li>Adding a spend transaction and a tag</li>
<li>Viewing spending breakdown based on the tags (categories)</li>
<li>Viewing financial health rate (based on the spending to income ratio) </li>
<li>Viewing spending frequency </li>
<li>Viewing bills and subscriptions and automatically add them on to the monthly breakdown </li>

## TWA development potential
There's a great potential for the mini app development in the following directions:
<li>User wallets/cards integration</li>
<li>Advanced statistics</li>
<li>Inline commands integration for a quick transaction adding process</li>
<br>
We envision that the TWAs will become organic and familiar for the users and such a use case will showcase a real-world daily usage of the TWAs.

# Third-party integrations 
For the mini app development we used a couple of different integrations to support the PoC.

### Data visualisation
For data visualisation we used a <a href="https://d3js.org/"> D3 by Observable library.

### UI Implementation
<li>For the date picker we implemented a react-ios-picker</a>, </li>
<li>the emoji picker is from <a href="https://github.com/ealush/emoji-picker-react"> ealush's library </a>, </li>
<li> Animations are done with the help of <a href="https://www.react-spring.dev/"> React Spring</a></li>
<li><a href="https://keen-slider.io/">Keen Slider</a> was a library for sliders</li>
